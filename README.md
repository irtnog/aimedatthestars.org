This website uses [BOOTSTRA.386](https://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but see also [Bootstrap 4 Github Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Content can be authored in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), but HTML is preferred.

## Development Environment

1. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), e.g., on Ubuntu 20.04, run `apt-get install -y jekyll ruby-dev build-essential`.

2. In a local clone of this repository, run `bundle config set path .rubygems && bundle install`.  This will install everything you need to run GitHub Pages locally.

3. Still in the same working directory as above, start a local web server by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
