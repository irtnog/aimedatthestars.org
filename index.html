    <p><blockquote>A collective of explorers, sight-seers, and hangers-on.  Their
    charter is to study galactic phenomena, flora, and fauna, although
    they are suspected of dabbling in mercenarism and even piracy from
    time to time.</blockquote></p>

        <p>Join us in game!  Our members do a little bit of
        everything, from exploration, trading, and mining to PvE, AX,
        and PvP combat.  And join us in
        <a href="https://discord.gg/Rz5vGed">Discord</a>, too.  There
        are tonnes of useful resources for newbies and experts alike
        in the <code>#training</code> channel.</p>

        <h2>Our one rule</h2>
        <p>Discord and squadron membership are at the sole discretion
        of the command staff. To borrow from
        <a href="https://youtu.be/azbRhVCt8Rw">Lt. Gen. David Morrison,</a>
        those who think that it is OK to behave in a way that demeans
        or exploits their colleagues have no place on board this
        carrier. If that does not suit you, get out.</p>

        <h2>An independent collective</h2>
        <p>From our home in HIP 90810 on the frontier of
        human-controlled space, we spread our utopian ethos throughout
        the Bubble.  Make your mark on the galactic polity by helping
        us expand our influence!</p>
